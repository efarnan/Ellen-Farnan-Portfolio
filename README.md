# Ellen-Farnan-Portfolio 
##Front End Development - Project 1 (Learning People)
This is a Portfolio Website for Ellen Farnan. This website was designed and coded for Project 1 submission, as part of the Free People Front End Developers course. 
The website sets out Ellen Farnan's capabilites for Front End Development as a display future projects and provide contact infomation for potential employers and job opportunities. USers can also find links to my social media accounts, such as Linkedin, Github & Dribbl, to keep up to date with any latest projects.

##Brief
This website demonstrates some elements covered in the first modules on HTML & CSS, as requested per brief: 

-	Created an online Portfolio for yourself with a minimum of 3 pages or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.	Including Home, About and Contact Me. 
- An empty Portfolio page has also been included to upload future projects.
-	Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout.
-	Incorporate a footer at the bottom of each page. 
-	Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources using clear comments. Include the url of where you found the code (e.g. libraries or tutorials). 

I was able to apply the teaching from the course, and problem solve issues as they arouse. 
The Javascript element by Bret Cameron demostrates the ability to natigavte Github, and implement and adapt code elements found on Github for use in projects.
Illustrations have been designed by Ellen Farnan with the expection of Social Media icons which were free pngs from Icondrop by Iconscout, an Adobe XD plugin.

##UX
My portfolio webiste will be used for potential employers in future to both give a platform to highlight projects to demonstrate my professional capabilities and allow for easy contact. 

I chose what I felt was a minimalistic, yet fun and approachable color scheme and font.
