# Ellen-Farnan-Portfolio 
## Front End Development - Project 1 (Learning People)
This is a Portfolio Website for myself, Ellen Farnan. This website was designed and coded for the Project 1 submission, as part of the Free People Front End Developers course. 
The website is create to set out my capabilites for Front End Development as a display future projects and provide contact infomation for potential employers and job opportunities. Users can also find links to my social media accounts, such as Linkedin, Github & Dribbl, to keep up to date with any latest projects.

## Brief
This website demonstrates some elements covered in the first modules on HTML & CSS, as requested per brief: 

-	Created an online Portfolio for yourself with a minimum of 3 pages or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.	Including Home, About and Contact Me. 
- An empty Portfolio page has also been included to upload future projects.
-	Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout.
-	Incorporate a footer at the bottom of each page. 
-	Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources using clear comments. Include the url of where you found the code (e.g. libraries or tutorials). 

I was able to apply the teaching from the course, and problem solve issues as they arouse. 

The Javascript element by Bret Cameron demostrates the ability to natigavte Github, and implement and adapt code elements found on Github for use in projects.
Illustrations have been designed by myself, Ellen Farnan with the expection of Social Media icons which were free pngs from Icondrop by Iconscout, an Adobe XD plugin.
Images have been take from Unsplash, by photographers

## UX
My portfolio webiste will be used for potential employers in future to both give a platform to highlight projects to demonstrate my professional capabilities and allow for easy contact. 

### Design
I chose what I felt was a minimalistic, yet fun and approachable color scheme and font. I endevoured to have all text easily readable by keeping the contrast high, and font size not too small, or closely spaced. 
I added a scroll up at the bottom of the page to add ease to return again to the Home Section.

## Features
### Existing Features
-HOME
This includes my name and a brief desciption of my role. The background is a cursor responsive JS background based on code by Brett Cameron.

-ABOUT ME
This includes a short desciption of myself and a link to download a copy of my CV. Lorem Ipsum was used as I am still developing what will be my focus.

-WORK
This will show 4 examples of projects I will have worked on. At the moment, placeholder images have been used. Each image is clickable, and contains a project header.

-CONTACT ME
This includes my email, and links to social media sites - Github, Dribbl & Linkedin. A contact form, supported by Form Spree, has been included.

-FOOTER
This includes a copy right statement that the work is my own. 

-PROJECTEXAMPLE.HTML [External Page]
This is an example project page, which is to be updated as I create new projects. 

-NAVBAR
This contains links to all of the above sections, and for smaller screens will become a hamburger which will expand on click when the user wishes to nagivate.

### Future Features
-DESIGN
I want to in future incorporate the shapes / textures found in the illustration futher in the page.

-WORK
I want to add a skills section demostrating the software and coding languages which I am most proficient in. 
I would like to expand the project section, and futher develop a tag system with the ability to filter. 


## Technology Used
The project used the following technologies to create:
 - HTML5
    - I used HTML5 to build the basic elements and contents for the project.
 - CSS3
    - I used CSS3 to customise the style of my elements and contents.
 - Javascript
    - JS was used for both the cursor responsive background in the Home Section, as well as for the Hamburger button for small screens.
 - Abobe Illustrator 
    - I used Adobe Illustrator to create the illustration for the 
 - Adobe XD 
    - 
 - Adobe Color
    - I used Adobe color to find and test the color schemes, and to pull the hex code for use in CSS and JS.
 - Replit 
    - I initially used Replit to write and test code for the project. However, I encountered issues with inconsitencies between the deployed site and the display on Replit itself. I ended up changing from this to complete the project.
 - Visual Studio 
    - I used Visual Studio to complete the writing and testing of the project.
 - GitHub 
    - as a remote repository, as per project brief, to push and store the versions of my project. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website.
 - Form Spree
    - I used FormSpree to support the backend management and to add security for the contact form.

## Testing Checklist
### HTML and CSS Validation
- To validate my HTML code, I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) tool. 
- To validate my CSS code, I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) tool.

### Screen Responsitivity 
- To test how the project would react to different for different screens, I used the Google Devloper console on the brower through pushing the code to the browers and the shortcut of `Ctrl + 'i'`

## Bugs or Problems
 - **Coding Software:** I initially started the project using Replit. However, once deployed on Github, the css appeared differently than it had in the viewing screen inside of the programme. I then stepped away from Replit and used Visual Studio instead, which proved easier to see what the true final project would look like.
 - **Small Screen Responive:** After my inital pass, when tested on the developer console in Google it became clear that the project would not function correctly for smaller screens. I revised the CSS to include `media queries` and `CSS Grid` & `Flexbox` to give the content the necessary responsiveness for mobile or tablet screens. 
 
## Deployment
The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.

2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.

3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.

4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.

5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'monkees-milestone-project-one'.

6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

`git remote add origin https://github.com/hebs87/monkees-milestone-project-one.git`

`git push -u origin master`

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.

8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.

9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.

10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
